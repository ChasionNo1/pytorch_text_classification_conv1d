Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification

This code is based on the paper by Yoon Kim, 2014 - 'Convolutional Networks for Sentence Classification'.
The dependencies are pytorch, torchtext. This implementation uses FastText embeddings instead of Word2Vec ones, 
but obtains a comparable accuracy on the IMDB movie review dataset, which is similar to the one from that paper.

Please allow for 6.6GB download for the embeddings; it will occur automatically when running ```main.py```.
